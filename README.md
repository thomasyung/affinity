affinity
========

Simple affinity diagram tool that you can install on your own web server.

**Installation:**

Put the files in a folder on your web server. Make sure the web server has write access to this folder.

**Future work:**

This is a work in progress. I hope to add the following features: 

* Real-time collaboration with others
* Share diagrams with others
